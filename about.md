Well, if you're on that page I guess you'd like to know a bit more about me.

## My story

### The begining

I was born on a really bad rainy day, on November, Friday 13th around 13:13 in the year of 1992.
After a few years in kindergarten, primary school, middle school and high school, I decided to join the school of Epitech.

### The training

For 3 years I went from total ignorant of anything related to software development to develop a ticketing system for one of the biggest french insurance company (GMF), developing 2 apps from scratch on Tizen operating system, recoding a lot of the standard C library. I also made a sudoku solver, a bomberman, a tower defense. That was pretty intense but necessary.
After these 3 years at Epitech Bordeaux, I went to study in China, at 北京交通大学 (Beijing Jiaotong University) where I learn about process management, android, quality management, a bit of Chinese language and well I also discovered I really liked China.
After that year abroad I went back to France to finish my studies at Epitech Paris and I followed with great interest the strategy, marketing and finance classes and decided to work in a startup environment as to explore as many domains as possible.

### The rise

I joined a 4 month-old startup called "Groupeer Technologies" as a late-founder and I spent time developing embeded software, android, iOS, as well as defining design, specifications, but also helping in sales, marketing and customer feedback. It was that experience that made me enjoy the entrepreneurship. I kept doing that for around 3 years before I decided to get back to China.
I then joined a company in Shenzhen named Asia Inspection (now renamed Qima) as a simple web developer. After half a year there, I've obtain enough work experience in China to finally start my journey to the unknown.

### The journey

I jumped in a train from Shenzhen to Shanghai with the idea to launch my own business. I drafted a business plan, submitied it to the local government in order to obtain the infamous "Entrepreneur VISA" and that was it, I became an entrepreneur.
